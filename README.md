# Organization App

## Purpose
The Organization App is a Django-based application that allows users to retrieve data using a NIP (Numer Identyfikacji Podatkowej) number by interacting with the RegonAPI. This application is designed to facilitate access to organizational data in Poland.

## Getting Started

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```
   REGONAPIKEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:
```

```
This command will build the Docker containers and start the application. You can access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running Tests
